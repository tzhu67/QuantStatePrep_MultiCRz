# Quantum state preparation with multi-controlled RZ gates and 1-qubit gates
## This is the initial submission for Erdos QC Boot Camp Summer 2025, Project II. A complete submission is still in progress.
Initial Steps:
1. QSP is constructed by induction on dimension.
2. Only Ry and X gates are involved.
3. Ry can be represented by Rz.
